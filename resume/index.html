        <ul>
          <li>Built and maintained a component library and design system based on a React and Tailwind in a Lerna monorepo as a part of an agile team that supported 10+ application teams. I was responsible for the development of high visibility, responsive components including the header and sidebar navigation used by all applications. My responsibilities also included maintenance of existing components, addressing support requests, and reviewing contributions to the internal open source library. </li>
          <li>Resident CSS expert on my team. I worked with teams across the company to fix styling bugs, build complex animations, and ensure styling consistency across all applications. </li>
          <li>Initiated a project to add Style Dictionary to our monorepo for managing design tokens provided in a JSON file by the UX team. The output of this project provided more ways for DTN application teams to use consistent styles outside our components. I was also able to leverage the Javascript output from Style Dictionary to set up a tailwind config file to ensure consistency with the Figma file used by the UX team. Setting up Style Dictionary allowed us to rapidly build dark mode in our components.</li>
          <li>Built documentation / internal marketing website page templates  for our component library. I was responsible for fleshing out the design from lo-fidelity wireframes to be engaging and to ensure our components looked good.</li>

      <p>Quilt Generator is a procedural quilt pattern generator implemented in JavaScript.  By changing parameters, such as the types of block patterns, the color palette, and the frequency that each is repeated, the code generates a unique quilt pattern. The generator can match up edges to create cellular automata-like patterns. I created this generator with an intent to sew a real quilt based on one of these patterns.
